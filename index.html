                <h1>A Journey of David's Coding</h1>
                <p><i><u>About the creator:</u></i> <br>
                    David Nguyen is a 19 year old studying a <i>Bachelor's of Software Engineering and Computer Science</i>. 
                    He is currently in his third year and plans to graduate by 2022 (Hopefully!). Although it is a hefty five-year long course, David has grown to love
                    programming, and enjoys it as a hobby as much as a potential career. Be that as it may, David pours any free time he can get into curating his skills both
                    on the computer and in the real world to become a better programmer and a better person every day. <br> <br>
                    <i><u>About this website:</u></i> <br>
                    This website was a product of his endeavour into web development in November of 2019. 
                    This space is a dedicated portfolio of David's projects and learning, which will grow and flourish along with his web development techniques in order to create
                    a reflective space for all to enjoy. On that note, please enjoy :)</p>
